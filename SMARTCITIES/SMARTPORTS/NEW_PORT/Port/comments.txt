1.- 'id' There is a clear definition of the id, however the system (NGSI-LD would create a machine generated id). Would not be this id renamed, in example, to identifier
4.- 'portType' Are these categories coming from any regulation?
5.-'gln' why the link is pointing to gs1 indonesia?
6.- Port. The example is clearly not real. The problem are not the real values, but that it is not test in real use case scenarios
