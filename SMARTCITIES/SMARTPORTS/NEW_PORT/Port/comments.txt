1.- 'id' There is a clear definition of the id, however the system (NGSI-LD would create a machine generated id). Would not be this id renamed, in example, to identifier
2.- 'countryCode' if there is a list could be included also an enum clause with the possible values?. should not be named unlocode?
3.- 'portCode'. What are these references [EMSWE2:DG-004-04][IALA-S211-portCode][UN-EDIFACT:LOC]
4.- 'portType' Are these categories coming from any regulation?
5.-'gln' why the link is pointing to gs1 indonesia?
6.- Port. The example is clearly not real. The problem are not the real values, but that it is not test in real use case scenarios
