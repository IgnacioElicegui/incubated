# SUMMARY

Directory to store the structure of the datamodels proposed to map a complete RAMI4.0 Asset Adminitration Shell (AAS).
This is developed, deployed and tested within the scope of [CoRoSect EU project](https://corosect.eu/).

# Origin

This Smart Data Model is a proposal to translate and manage within NGSI (exploiting the capabilities of a FIWARE environment) a [RAMI4.0](https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/a2-schweichhart-reference_architectural_model_industrie_4.0_rami_4.0.pdf) **Asset Administration Shell** (AAS). This is planned to be used as part of a FIWARE for Industry (F4I) framework to foster the uses cases and pilots to be deployed in the CoRoSect project.

# Structure

The proposed set of NGSI Entities represents the different parts of the AAS schema proposed by Industry4.0 to create the Digital Twin of a device/system involved in the manufacturing chain of a I4.0 framework. According to the figure below, these entities are linked (refenced) between them to create the final AAS.
