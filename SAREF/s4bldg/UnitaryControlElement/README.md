Version: 0.0.2

## Description 

A unitary control element combines a number of control components into a single product, such as a thermostat or humidistat.  A unitary control element provides a housing for an aggregation of control or electrical distribution elements that, in combination, perform a singular (unitary) purpose. Each item in the aggregation may have its own geometric representation and location.
