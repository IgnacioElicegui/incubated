## Example payloads    

#### Building NGSI-v2 key-values Example    

Here is an example of a Building in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.  

```json  

{
  
  "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:a3b15710-993b-4af9-9a28-bdccdf936948",
