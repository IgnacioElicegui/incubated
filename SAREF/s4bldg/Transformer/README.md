# Transformer
Version: 0.0.2

## Description 

A transformer is an inductive stationary device that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another.  Transformer is used to transform electric power; conversion of electric signals for other purposes is handled at other entities: Controller converts arbitrary signals, AudioVisualAppliance converts signals for audio or video streams, and CommunicationsAppliance converts signals for data or other communications usage.
