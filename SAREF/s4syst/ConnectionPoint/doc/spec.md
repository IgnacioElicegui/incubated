Global description: **The class of connection points of systems, at which they may be connected to other systems. This class qualifies properties s4syst:connectsSystem and s4syst:connectedThrough. A connection point belongs to exactly one system. Any system connected through a connection is connected at one of its connection points to the connection. The system of a connection point that is connected through a connection is itself connected through the connection.**

## Example payloads    

#### ConnectionPoint NGSI-v2 key-values Example    

Here is an example of a ConnectionPoint in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.  

```json  

{
  
  "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:ConnectionPoint:deda21d2-807a-4444-b501-e6ae29ad6b1f",
  
  "type": "ConnectionPoint",
  
  "connectionPointOf": "urn:ngsi-ld:ConnectionPoint:eb7ea7c4-d51a-483f-bd15-d62af8f8f2b7",

#### ConnectionPoint NGSI-LD normalized Example    

Here is an example of a ConnectionPoint in JSON-LD format as normalized. This is compatible with NGSI-LD when not using options and returns the context data of an individual entity.  

```json  

{
  
  "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:ConnectionPoint:20eee2b1-a7c5-4043-9e98-57c6665ce1fe",
  
  "type": "ConnectionPoint",
  
  "connectionPointOf": {
  
    "type": "Relationship",
  
    "object": "urn:ngsi-ld:ConnectionPoint:85945672-ee4a-47db-9081-163a2b78bf11"
  
  },
  
  "dateCreated": {
  
    "type": "Property",
  
    "value": "2023-01-25T18:06:37Z"
  
  },
  
  "dateModified": {
  
    "type": "Property",
  
    "value": "2023-01-25T20:09:45Z"
  
  },
  
  "source": {
  
    "type": "Property",
  
    "value": "Import"
  
  },
  
  "name": {
  
    "type": "Property",
  
    "value": "ConnectionPoint"
  
  },
  
  "alternateName": {
  
    "type": "Property",
  
    "value": "ConnectionPoint type 2"
  
  },
  
  "description": {
