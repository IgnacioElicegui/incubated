  "description": "This class represents a Business Event, which specialises Event. A Business Event is a specific situation or event in the lifecycle of a business that fulfils one or more needs or (legal) obligations of that business at this specific point in time. A Business Event requires a set of public services to be delivered and consumed in order for the associated business need(s) or obligation(s) to be fulfilled. Business Events are defined within the context of a particular Member State. In other words, a Business Event groups together a number of public services that need to be delivered for completing that particular event.",
