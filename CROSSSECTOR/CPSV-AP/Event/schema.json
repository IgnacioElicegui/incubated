  "description": "This class represents an event that can be of any type that triggers, makes use of, or in some way is related to, a Public Service. It is not expected to be used directly, rather, one or other of its subclasses should be used. The properties of the class are, of course, inherited by those subclasses. The Event class is used as a hook either to a single related Public Service, such as diagnosis of illness being related to application for sickness benefit; or to a group of Public Services, such as all those related to the establishment of a new business.",
